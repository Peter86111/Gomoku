# Gomoku (Five in a Row) – Console Application

This project is a console-based implementation of the classic Gomoku (Five in a Row) game, written in C#.

The main goal of this project is learning and practicing:
- Object-Oriented Programming principles
- Console rendering
- Game logic separation
- Clean and readable code structure

---

## Features

- Two-player local gameplay
- Unicode-based board rendering
- Centered ASCII title screen
- Win condition checks (horizontal, vertical, diagonal)
- Clear separation of responsibilities (Game, Board, Render, Input)

---

## Current State

🚧 **This project is under active development.**

Planned improvements:
- Menu system
- Improved text and input alignment
- Letter-based X-axis (A–O instead of numbers)
- Code refactoring and documentation expansion
- Possible AI opponent (future goal)

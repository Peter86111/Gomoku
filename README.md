# Gomoku

**A simple console-based Gomoku game in C#.**

This is my first independent game project, implementing the classic Gomoku (Five in a Row) game. The goal is to place five identical marks (X or O) in a row on a 10x10 board—horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

## Key Features

Console-based gameplay with colored output

Simple player interaction (row/column input)

Solid win-detection logic for all directions

Current version: beta — core mechanics are functional and improving

## Planned Improvements

- Separate rendering logic from game logic

- Refactor player handling

- Improve graphics layer (decouple UI)

- Add restart option after game over

- Optional: AI player (easy mode)

## How to Play
